                                        When you use a technology application or visit a website providing Fintech services, 
                                        you are often presented with a series of detailed tutorials on how to use the features on the app or website, as well as how they work. However, the problem is that if you have
                                        a solid foundation in technology, you may find these tutorials too detailed and filled with 
                                        information you already know, making it frustrating to have to click the "skip" button repeatedly.
                                        On the other hand, if you are not tech-savvy or have limited knowledge of technology 
                                        you may feel that the standardized tutorials do not provide enough instruction to help you
                                         effectively use the features on the app or website.
                                        <br><br>
                                        A personalized tutorial tailored to your level of technological expertise and usage skills 
                                        is a great solution to enhance your experience on technology or Fintech apps and websites. 
                                        This is exactly why the "Personalized Tutorials" project was initiated. </p> 

                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        In the tech industry, particularly in Fintech, UX has become a key area of focus for companies looking to improve. The increasing competition in the industry has made it essential for companies to differentiate themselves through personalized experiences that drive customer satisfaction.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, with the complexity and diversity of product portfolios in the industry, it has become challenging to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict user behavior. The issue lies in the fact that user action data comes in various forms, making it difficult to create a unified data input for these models.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a result, there is a growing need for Machine Learning (ML) models that can make high-accuracy predictions on unlabeled input datasets and handle diverse types of data. This will enable the application of these models in downstream tasks related to personalized user experience (UX) to improve customer satisfaction.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>User problems landscape</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Tutorials are a vital component of Fintech apps and websites, serving as an introduction to features and providing users with step-by-step instructions on how to effectively use them. However, a common pain point arises when users are presented with generic tutorials that fail to account for their individual level of technical expertise.
                                        <br><br>
                                        When tutorials are not tailored to meet the user's needs, tech-savvy users often find themselves feeling bored, wasting time, and frustrated by the need to constantly click "skip" through content they already know. Meanwhile, non-tech users are left feeling lost and in need of more detailed guidance, highlighting the need for a more personalized and adaptive approach to tutorial design
                                    </p>

                                        <b>Contrastive learning</b> methods are used to build downstream models. This technique is deemed suitable for the 'Personalized Tutorials' solution because self-supervised learning methods can achieve high accuracy with unlabeled input data. Meanwhile, most user action data crawled from apps and websites are unlabeled due to the high diversity in features and product portfolios.

                                    <h2>Models building</h2>
                                    <p>This is the technical landscape, and the methods for implementing the steps from data wrangling to model construction are detailed below.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Data wrangling</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To ensure accuracy, reduce complexity, and increase the applicability of user event data to multiple models, the task of data processing is performed by converting all data into text-based format before importing data into downstream models for prediction.
                                        <br><br>
                                        All input data consists of user actions crawled from apps, websites, or application backends, with diverse data types, including categorical, float, and text, all of which are processed through the <b>BERT model</b> and converted into text-based data for the Contrastive learning model. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Build models</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The Contrastive learning model in this project is inspired by the <i>SimCLR framework</i>, developed by Google researchers. The core approach is outlined below:
                                    </p>
                                    <figure class="featured-image">

                                    <p><i>(source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709v3" target="_blank">A Simple Framework for Contrastive learning of Visual Representations</a>)</i></p>

                                    <p>
                                        The main objective of the Contrastive learning model is to minimize the distance between the anchor and positive sample, and maximize the distance between the anchor and negative sample.

                                        <br><br>
                                        With input dataset of users actions (or users events), a set of events from a customer is placed as the anchor, with a single event randomly removed from it to serve as a positive sample while other events that don’t occur for that customer are randomly sampled as negative. Contrastive learning tries to minimize the distance between the anchor and positive samples and at the same time maximize the distance to negative samples. At the end, a vector for each symbol in the vocabulary is produced and we aggregate them to get the customer representation.

                                    <h4>Data Augmentation</h4>
                                    <p>The first crucial step in the Contrastive learning model is Augmentation. At this stage, from each initial data sample, two random views, denoted as x˜i and x˜j, are generated and considered as a positive sample pair. To perform augmentation, the following two methods are proposed to be implemented simultaneously to achieve the best performance:

                                        <li>Synonym replacement: replaces tokens with similar or synonymous meanings in the text. Utilizes the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-wordnet-for-tagging/">WordNetTagger()</a> library to leverage Wordnet thesauruses, along with the <b>Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.</b></li>

                                        The data encoding operation is performed using the neural network approach. This framework allows the use of various network architectures. In this project, to ensure simplicity and applicability (applicable to multiple models), ResNet is chosen. The result of the encoding function f(.) is the <b>embedding vectors</b> hi, hj, with hi = f(x˜i) = ResNet(x˜i).

                                        <br><br>
                                        Next, <b>a small neural network (specifically, an MLP)</b> is used to map the embedding vectors to the location where the contrastive loss is performed, the output of this function is the embedding map. Represented in the figure as zi, zj.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In addition to the ResNet and MLP models, embedding map can also be generated through the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace" target="_blank">StarSpace model</a> developed by Meta.

                                        The loss function is a crucial component that determines the model's learning ability. There are several types of loss functions that can be used, including Triplet Loss, Lifted structured loss, and SimCLR Loss function. In this project, the <b>SimCLR loss function</b> is proposed for application. The loss function is as follows:
                                    </p>

                                        The system architecture of the solution is divided into two main branches: training model and serving model to address the specific problem of customized tutorials. The output of the training branch is a downstream model that has been fully trained with a high degree of accuracy, ready to be employed in the process, and the output of the serving branch is an event embedding that represents the predicted value of the user's familiarity with the technology. The output of the Downstream Model serving becomes the input of the downstream model to perform suggestions compatible with the user's needs.

                                        Kafka, an Event Streaming Platform, is proposed for use because it is suitable for large, complex systems, handling large amounts of data, and its ability to integrate with diverse environments. Additionally, <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods">Clojure Multimethods</a> are also proposed for handling customer event data.

                                        <li><b>Tutorials pop up as users visit apps or website at the first time:</b> because tutorials usually appear when users first enter apps or websites, at a time when they have not yet taken any meaningful actions.</li>

                                        The solution to this challenge is to <b>establish a clear rule</b>: when a user has completed <i>5-10 actions</i>, a customized tutorial will be triggered to appear, while initially, when a user first accesses the app or website, a brief instruction or overview will be displayed, and the user only needs to click the "Skip" button once.
